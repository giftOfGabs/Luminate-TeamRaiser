##TeamRaiser API Event Search with Geo Location
This can be used to leverage TeamRaiser API to get published client events near the user. You will need  the clients Blackbaud Luminate API key, and set up a Google Maps API Key. I suggest you set this up in the client's google account, as it is only free up to a certain amount of calls. You will need to add a call to the Google Map API with your API key at the end of your html
