# Luminate-TeamRaiser
Start up files used for projects on Blackbaud Luminate platform. Includes TeamRaiser API Event Search and Registration Flow Reset

<strong>-TeamRaiser API Event Search with Geo Location</strong><br />
This can be used to leverage TeamRaiser API to get published client events near the user. You will need  the clients Blackbaud Luminate API key, and set up a Google Maps API Key. I suggest you set this up in the client's google account, as it is only free up to a certain amount of calls. You will need to add the following with the Google Map API key you create at the end of your html:
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=googleMapsApiKey"></script>
<br /><br />
<strong>-Registration Reset</strong><br />
This includes common selectors to reset button and font styles in the Luminate TeamRaiser Registration flow. These will override the core styles set by the Luminate system allowing you to get a head start on applying new design styles to any TeamRaiser project.
